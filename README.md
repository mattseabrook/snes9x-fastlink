*Snes9x - Portable Super Nintendo Entertainment System (TM) emulator*

This is a fork of the official source code repository for the Snes9x project, cleaned up for 2024 and building as `C++ 20` in `VS 2022`. Importantly, a new feature has been implemented that adds a socket server on a dedicated thread that surfaces the entire state RAM of the emulated SNES. This behaves like a standard WWW Rest API on the `localhost:9000/`
